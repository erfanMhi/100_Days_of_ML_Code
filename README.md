# 100 Days Of ML Code - Example Log

### Day 0: February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Read NSGA-NET: A MULTI-OBJECTIVE GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR NEURAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH paper.

**Thoughts:** xxx

**Links to paper:** [NSGA-NET](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03522.pdf)

### Day 1: February 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Read efficient architecture search by network transformation paper and watched one video about data visulization and a video about Bayesian Optimization to have a shallow understanding about this topic.

**Thoughts:** Data visualization is an important topic which I should spend more time on.
